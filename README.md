# topfew-nim

This is a Nim port of Tim Bray's `topfew` program.

* [TopFew introduction](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/03/27/Topfew-and-Amdahl) (Blog post)
* [Original go-lang TopFew implementation](https://github.com/timbray/topfew) (GitHub link)

## Why?

The intent was:
- to explore the relative performance, expressiveness of Go vs Nim vs Rust
- learn more Nim in the process, particularly writing efficient/high-performance Nim code

## Building

For a debug build,

```sh
$ nimble build
```

For a production (optimized) build,

```sh
$ nimble -d:danger --opt:speed --passC:-flto --passL:-flto build
```

## Benchmarking

1) Install the [Hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) benchmarking tool

2) (Optional) Set the `GO_CMD` and `RUST_CMD` environment variables to point to your pre-built Go-lang/Rust topfew executables, e.g.,

```sh
$ export GO_CMD=~/git/topfew/bin/tf
```

3) Run `nimble bench`

PS: The `bench` Nimble task has only been tested (and written for) the Linux platform

PPS: As of today (2022-01-15), the Rust version does not support the same feature set as the Nim/Go implementations.  It does not support single-threaded mode (`-w 1`), nor does it support regex-based filtering (`-g ...`), nor sed-style substitutions (`-s ...`).  For the most basic use-case, with field selection only (`-f ...`), it performs on par with the Go implementation on my system.

## Results

Here are sample results (as of January '22) from my laptop.

In both current implementations, the performance story is mixed.  Performance is measured on a 486MB file (`access.log.xlarge`).  This file may be downloaded from https://alphagame.dev/ by adding `access.log.xlarge.gz` to the URL.

## single-threaded
```sh
$ ./topfew -w 1 -f 7 access.log.xlarge
```
| Command | Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] | Relative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `Nim` | 940.4 ± 57.9 | 878.1 | 1008.8 | 2.29 ± 0.14 |
| `Go` | 410.7 ± 4.5 | 404.4 | 416.6 | 1.00 |

## multi-threaded
```sh
$ ./topfew -f 7 access.log.xlarge
```
| Command | Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] | Relative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `Nim` | 314.3 ± 31.3 | 271.9 | 350.3 | 1.83 ± 0.23 |
| `Go` | 171.7 ± 13.6 | 139.5 | 206.4 | 1.00 |

## regex filter
```sh
$ ./topfew -f 7 -g "googlebot|bingbot|Twitterbot" access.log.xlarge
```
| Command | Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] | Relative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `Nim` | 789.7 ± 21.6 | 762.3 | 818.1 | 1.00 |
| `Go` | 7198.4 ± 131.9 | 7061.5 | 7366.0 | 9.12 ± 0.30 |

## sed substitutions
```sh
$ ./topfew -f 4 -s "\[[^:]*:" "" -s ":.*\$" "" -n 24 access.log.xlarge
```
| Command | Mean [s] | Min [s] | Max [s] | Relative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `Nim` | 4.564 ± 0.077 | 4.476 | 4.635 | 5.44 ± 0.10 |
| `Go` | 0.839 ± 0.006 | 0.834 | 0.847 | 1.00 |

## Expressiveness

At this time, since the Nim version is basically a transliteration (read: follows the same structure and algorithm as the go-lang implementation), the line counts are comparable, although the Nim code is a bit shorer.

```sh
$ find . -type f -name "*.go" | grep -v test | xargs wc -l
  192 ./main.go
  122 ./internal/keyfinder.go
  163 ./internal/segmenter.go
    2 ./internal/package.go
   33 ./internal/stream.go
   43 ./internal/sampler.go
  143 ./internal/counter.go
   74 ./internal/filters.go
  772 total
```

```sh
$ find . -type f -name "*.nim" | grep -v test | xargs wc -l
  148 ./src/topfew.nim
  143 ./src/topfew/segmenter.nim
   30 ./src/topfew/sampler.nim
   97 ./src/topfew/keyfinder.nim
  103 ./src/topfew/counter.nim
   51 ./src/topfew/filter.nim
   25 ./src/topfew/utils.nim
   30 ./src/topfew/streaming.nim
  627 total
```

No attempts at optimizing the code size or code-golfing were made to reduce the LoCs of the Nim implementation.
