## Extract a key from a record based on a list of keys. If the list is empty, the key is the whole record.
##  Otherwise there's a list of fields. They are extracted, joined with spaces, and that's the key

## First implementation was regexp based but Golang regexps are slow.  So we'll use a hand-built state machine that
##  only cares whether each byte encodes space-or-tab or not.

## NER is the error message returned when the input has less fields than the KeyFinder is configured for.
const NER = "not enough bytes in record"
